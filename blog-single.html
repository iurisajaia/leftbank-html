          The multi-purpose space, once a bread factory in the Soviet era, sits

          The multi-purpose space, once a bread factory in the Soviet era, sits
          on the left bank of the Georgian capital. It was originally due to
          open in February until the pandemic struck and pushed the date back
          eight months. In line with local Covid-19 restrictions, the venue is
          currently only using its outdoor area, hosting limited-capacity day
          parties on Fridays and Saturdays, plus free film screenings on
          Sundays. This weekend, Tbilisi DJs Kraumur and Sevda will spin on the
          6th and 7th respectively. Sunday's movie is Heaven Knows What. Doors
          close at 10 PM.
